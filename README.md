# Dog-Breed-Prediction

Requirments: 
Keras==2.4.3
opencv_python==4.4.0.46
numpy==1.18.5
streamlit==0.71.0

In this project, we will see how to use Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. This is a supervised learning problem, specifically a multiclass classification problem.
